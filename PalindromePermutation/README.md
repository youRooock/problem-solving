### Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangment of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
`Example: Input: 'Tact Coa', Output: True (for permutations: 'taco cat', 'atco cta' etc)`
